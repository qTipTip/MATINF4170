    \begin{abstract}
        In this assignment we explore further properties of B-splines,
        especially related to multiple knots and evaluation at knots. We also
        implement an algorithm for evaluating a spline function $f$ at a
        parameter $x$, stemming from the spline matrix representation of spline
        functions.
    \end{abstract}

    \section*{Exercise 2.2}
    \label{sec:exercise_2_2}
    In this exercise we want to find the individual polynomial pieces of the
    cubic B-splines:
    \begin{enumerate}[i)]
        \item $B[0, 0, 0, 0, 1](x)$;
        \item $B[0, 1, 1, 1, 1](x)$;
        \item $B[0, 1, 1, 1, 2](x)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Instead of computing these directly, we first show the general claim that
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        B[a, \overbrace{b, \ldots, b}^p, c](x) = \frac{(x-a)^p}{(b-a)^p}B[a,
        b](x) + \frac{(c-x)^p}{(c-b)^p}B[b, c](x),
    \end{equation}
    outlined in exercise 2.7 (note that we do allow $a = b$, $b = c$).
    \paragraph{Base case}
    We proceed by induction, and the base case consists of $p = 0$. The right
    hand side then directly evaluates to $B[a, b](x) + B[b, c](x)$, which is
    equal to $B[a, c]$ as the knot intervals are adjacent.

    \paragraph{Induction step} For the inductive
    step, we assume the claim holds for $p = k-1$, and show it must also hold
    for $p = k$. We then have
    \begin{align*}
        B[a, \overbrace{b, \ldots, b}^k, c](x) &= \frac{(x-a)}{(b-a)} B[a,
        \underbrace{\overbrace{b, \ldots, b}^{k-1}, b}_k](x)+
        \frac{(c-x)}{(c-b)}B[\underbrace{b, \overbrace{b, \ldots, b}^{k-1}}_{k},
        c](x),
        \intertext{and applying the induction hypothesis yields}
        &= \frac{(x-a)^k}{(b-a)^k}B[a, b](x) + \frac{(c-x)^k}{(c-b)^k}B[b, c](x).
    \end{align*}
    This closes the induction. It then follows that
    \begin{enumerate}[i)]
        \item $B[0, 0, 0, 0, 1](x) = (1 - x)^3B[0, 1](x)$;
        \item $B[0, 1, 1, 1, 1](x) = x^3B[0, 1](x)$;
        \item $B[0, 1, 1, 1, 2](x) = x^3B[0, 1](x) + (2 - x)^3B[1, 2](x)$,
    \end{enumerate}
    using the zero-convention. This can be verified by direct computation.

    When it comes to smoothness, if we have a knot $t_j$ of multiplicity $m$,
    then the derivatives of the spline $B_{j, p}$ of order $0, 1, \ldots, p -
    m$ are continuous at the knot $t_j$. For the above B-splines, we have knot
    multiplicity of 4, 4 and 3 respectively, hence for $B[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]$ we
    have a discontinuity at $x = 0$ as $p - m = 3 - 4 = -1$. This can also be
    seen by comparing the two limits at 0. By the same token, $B[0, 1, 1, 1,
    1]$ has a discontinuity at $x = 1$. The B-spline $B[0, 1, 1, 1, 2]$ on the
    other hand exhibits $C^0$ continuity at the knot $x = 1$.

    \section*{Exercise 2.6}

    \subsection*{Induction proof}

    We wish to show the identity
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:statement}
        B(t_i \mid t_j, \ldots, t_{j+p+1}) = B(t_j \mid t_i, \ldots, t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{j + i + p})
    \end{equation}
    holds for $i = j, \ldots, j+p+1$.

    \paragraph{Base case:} Note that the B-spline on the right hand
    side is one degree lower than that on the left. Hence, our base case
    consists of $p = 1$. With $p = 1$ we have three cases: $t_i = t_j, t_{j+1}$
    and $t_{j+2}$. In general we have
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        B(x \mid t_j, t_{j+1}, t_{j+2}) = \frac{x - t_j}{t_{j+1} - t_j} B(x \mid t_j, t_{j+1})
                                        + \frac{t_{j+2} - x}{t_{j+2} - t_{j+1}} B(x \mid t_{j+1}, t_{j+2}).
    \end{equation}
    Plugging in $x = t_j$ both terms evaluates to zero, and since $t_j$ is
    outside the interval $[t_{j+1}, t_{j+2})$, the right hand side of
    \ref{eq:statement} also evaluates to zero. By symmetry, the same holds for
    $x = t_{j+2}$. For $x = t_{j+1}$, we get $B(x \mid t_j, t_{j+1}) = 0$,
    while $B(x \mid t_{j+1}, t_{j+2}) = 1$. By definition, the right hand side
    of \cref{eq:statement} also evaluates to 1. This concludes the base case.

    \paragraph{Induction step:}
    For the inductive step, we assume that \cref{eq:statement} holds for degree
    $p - 1$. For degree $p$, the left hand side of \cref{eq:statement} then
    reads:
    {\small
    \begin{align*}
        &B(t_i \mid t_j, \ldots, t_{j+p+1}) = \frac{t_i - t_j}{t_{j+p} - t_j} B(t_i \mid t_j \ldots t_{j+p})
        + \frac{t_{j+p+1} - t_i}{t_{j+p+1} - t_{j+1}} B(t_i \mid t_{j+1} \ldots t_{j+p+1}),
    \intertext{\normalsize which by the induction hypothesis yields}
    &\frac{t_i - t_j}{t_{j+p} - t_j} B(t_i \mid t_j \ldots, t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{j+p})
        + \frac{t_{j+p+1} - t_i}{t_{j+p+1} - t_{j+1}}B(t_i \mid t_{j+1}, \ldots, t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{j+p+1}).
    \end{align*}
    }%
    Evaluating the right hand side of \cref{eq:statement} using the recursive
    definition, yields the same result. This closes the induction.

    \subsection*{Application}

    We use the result proved above to evaluate the second order B-spline $B_{j,
    2}$ at its interior knots, $t_{j+1}$ and $t_{j+2}$. The first interior knot gives
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        B(t_{j+1} \mid t_j, \ldots, t_{j+3}) = B(t_{j+1} \mid t_j, t_{j+2}, t_{j+3})
        = \frac{t_{j+1} - t_j}{t_{j+2} - t_j} \underbrace{B(t_{j+1} \mid t_j, t_{j+2})}_{= 1} = \frac{t_{j+1} - t_j}{t_{j+2} - t_j}.
    \end{equation}
    For the second interior knot, we have
    {\small
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        B(t_{j+2} \mid t_j, \ldots, t_{j+3}) = B(t_{j+2} \mid t_j, t_{j+1}, t_{j+3})
        = \frac{t_{j+3} - t_{j+2}}{t_{j+3} - t_{j+1}} \underbrace{B(t_{j+2} \mid t_{j+1}, t_{j+3})}_{= 1}
        = \frac{t_{j+3} - t_{j+2}}{t_{j+3} - t_{j+1}}.
    \end{equation}
    }%

    \subsection*{Repeated interior knots}

    Assume now that we all interior knots are equal to some number $z$, i.e.,
    we have knot multiplicity $p$ at interior knots. That is $t_j < z <
    t_{j+p+1}$. By repeated use of the above result, we have that the $j$th
    B-spline can be evaluated as such:
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        B(z \mid t_j, \underbrace{z, \ldots, z}_{p}, t_{j+p+1}) = B(z \mid t_j, t_{j+p+1}) = 1
    \end{equation}
    as $z$ lies in the interval $[t_j, t_{j+p+1})$. If we instead consider the
    B-splines $B_{i, p}$ where $i \neq j$ evaluated at $z$, then we have two cases:
    \begin{enumerate}[i)]
        \item No equal knots, in which case $B_{i, p}(z) = 0$,
        \item $k \leq p$ equal knots, either at the left or right end of the active knots:
            \begin{align*}
                &B(z \mid t_i, \ldots, t_{i + p - k}, \underbrace{z, \ldots, z}_{k}) = B(z \mid t_i, t_{i + p - k}) = 0
                \intertext{or}
                &B(z \mid \underbrace{z, \ldots, z}_{k}, t_{i+k}, \ldots, t_i + p + 1) = B(z \mid t_{i + k}, \ldots,  t_{i + p + 1}) = 0
            \end{align*}
            by repeated application of above result.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section*{Exercise 2.11}
    \label{sec:exercise_2_11}

    Given a knot vector $t = \left\{ t_j \right\}_{j=1}^{n+p+1}$ and a real
    number $x \in [t_1, \ldots, t_{n+p+1})$ we often find ourselves needing to
    determine exactly what knot interval the number $x$ lies in, e.g.,
    determine the index $\mu$ such that $t_\mu \leq x < t_{\mu+1}$. There are
    many ways of achieving this, and sometimes one can tailor the procedure to
    current context in order to achieve better performance. We examine a few
    methods, demonstrated in \textsc{Python}, and for all of these we assume $x
    \in [t_1, \ldots, t_{n+p+1})$. These have yet to be tested in a proper
    setting.

    \paragraph{Naive approach}
    \label{par:evaluation_approach}
    More often than not, when we repeatedly evaluate B-splines it is because we
    want to compute a set of points on the curve. We can use this, as well as
    the fact that knot sequences are increasing to our advantage. Letting the
    function start searching at the previous index, we significantly reduce the
    number of iterations.
    \begin{minted}{python}
def IndexEvaluation(x, knots, previous=0):
    for i in range(previous, len(knots-1)):
        if knots[i] <= x < knots[i+1]:
            return i
    \end{minted}

    \paragraph{Binary approach}
    \label{par:binary_evaluation_approach}

    We could also hope to combine the binary search method with the one using
    the previous index as a starting point, to further narrow down our search
    range. 
    
    \begin{minted}{python}
def IndexBinaryEvaluation(x, knots, previous=0):
    a = previous
    b = len(knots)-1
    while a <= b:
        c = (a + b) // 2
        if knots[c] <= x < knots[c+1]:
            return c
        else:
            if x < knots[c]:
                b = c - 1
            else:
                a = c + 1
    \end{minted}
    \section*{Exercise 2.13} 

    In this exercise we want to implement the algorithm for evaluating a spline
    function $f$ given by
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        f(x) = \sum^{n}_{i=1} c_i B_{i, p}(x)
    \end{equation}
    where $n$ is the number of basis functions of degree $p$, and $c_i$ are the
    given spline coefficients. The code was implemented in \textsc{Python}, and
    can be seen in \cref{lst:spline_func}. If no $\mu$ was supplied, one of the
    above routines for determining $\mu$ is used. The algorithm was used to
    compute and visualize the cubic \emph{variation diminishing spline
    approximation} $Q[f]$ to the function $f(x) = \sin(x)$ on the clamped knot
    vector
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        t = (-1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5), 
    \end{equation}
    and can be seen in \cref{fig:variation_dim}.

    \section*{Exercise 2.17}
    
    In this exercise, we examine what happens when the algorithm in exercise
    2.13 is called with an $x$ \emph{not} in the knot interval $[t_\mu,
    t_{\mu+1})$. I found it hard to determine exactly what is computed by the
    algorithms in this case, so following is a general discussion.

    Some of the benefits of the spline algorithms are that all combinations are
    \emph{convex}. By applying the spline algorithms to an $x$ outside of the
    relevant knot interval $[t_\mu, t_{\mu+1})$, we lose this property, and we
    get weird results that depend on exactly which interval $x$ lies in.

    Take for instance the last step in Algorithm 2.20, that is
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        f(x) = \boldsymbol{c}_p = \begin{pmatrix}
            \frac{t_{\mu+1} - x}{t_{\mu + 1} - t_\mu} & \frac{x - t_\mu}{t_{\mu+1} - t_\mu}
        \end{pmatrix}
        \begin{pmatrix} 
            c_{\mu-1, p - 1}\\ c_{\mu, p-1}.
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    If we happen to have $x < t_\mu$, then the left matrix coefficient becomes
    greater than one, while the right one becomes negative, and hence
    $c_{\mu-1, p-1}$ is weighted higher than $c_{\mu, p-1}$. Similarly, for $x
    > t_{\mu + 1}$ the exact opposite happens. Affine, non-convex combinations
    like these, for every step of the algorithm, does not suit computers well
    and the results become unstable.
     
    \section*{Exercise 2.19}
    \label{sec:exercise_2_19}

    Given the knot vector $t = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)$, we can only define \emph{one}
    B-spline of degree three. Say we want to evaluate $B_{1, 3, t}(x)$ for some $x
    \in (0, 4)$. We can do this using the recursive definition, however, if we
    wish to evaluate this using Algorithm 2.20 or Algorithm 2.21, we run into
    trouble. In order to evaluate the splines at a point $x \in [t_\mu,
    t_{\mu+1})$ the algorithms are reliant on the knots $t_{\mu - p + 1},
    \ldots, t_{\mu + p}$. Say for example, $\mu = 1$, then we need the knots
    $t_{-2}, t_{-1}, t_0$ in addition, and if $\mu = 5$, we need the knots
    $t_6, t_7, t_8$. 

    Recall that the spline space $\mathbb{S}_{p, t}$ is defined by
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        \mathbb{S}_{p, t} \coloneqq \Big\{ \sum^{n}_{j=1} c_jB_{j, p} \mid c_j
        \in \mathbb{R}, 1 \leq j \leq n \Big\}.
    \end{equation}

    We can resolve the above problem by introducing the augmented knot vector 
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        \tau = (-1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5).
    \end{equation}
    and instead consider $B_{1, 3, t}$ as a function in the spline space
    $\mathbb{S}_{p, \tau}$.  With respect to this new knot vector, the B-spline
    $B_{1, 3, t}$ can be equivalently expressed as $B_{5, 3, \tau}$, where our
    relevant index now is $\mu^\prime = 5$. Now, the algorithm implemented in
    Exercise 2.13 computes arbitrary functions in a spline space, given the
    knot vector, polynomial degree, and  set of coefficients.  With the
    coefficients $c = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)$, knot vector $\tau$ with
    index $\mu = 5$, and degree $p$, the algorithm computes the spline function
    $B_{5, 3, \tau}(x)$. Hence, we can reclaim the functions in the original
    spline space in the augmented spline space by choosing suitable knots and
    considering them as spline functions in a larger spline space.

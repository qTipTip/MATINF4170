    \section*{Exercise 1.3}
    \label{sec:exercise_1_3}
    
    In this exercise we take a look at the Neville-Aitken algorithm for
    evaluating points on an interpolating curve. In the general setup we are
    given $p+1$ control points, $\left\{ c_j \right\}_{j=0}^p$, as well as
    $p+1$ strictly increasing parameter values $\left\{ t_j \right\}_{j=0}^p$.
    The integer $p$ ends up being the degree of the interpolating polynomial.
    The algorithm was implemented in \textsc{Python} and the source code is
    given in \Cref{lst:nev_ait}.  We wish to interpolate $N$ points on the
    semicircle $\mathcal{C} \coloneqq \left\{ \left( \cos(t), \sin(t) \right)
    \mid t \in [0, \pi]\right\}$ and study the effect of varying the number of
    interpolation points $N$, as well as the effect of varying the parameter
    values. 
   
    We chose two distinct parametrizations, one being the uniform
    parametrization given by
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        t_{j+1} - t_j = 1
    \end{equation}
    for $j = 0, \ldots, N-1$ and with $t_0 = 0$. The other one being tailored
    to misbehave for increasing $N$ was generated using a cumulative sum of
    random numbers, that is:
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        t_{j+1} - t_j = r_j
    \end{equation}
    where $r_j$ is a random integer in $\mathbb{Z}_5$ and $t_0 = 0$.  The
    uniform parametrization behaved quite nicely under increasing $N$, as can
    be seen in \Cref{fig:uniform}.  The random parametrization on the other
    hand was very unstable under increasing $N$ and hence yields a very bad
    interpolation to the semi circle for large $N$.

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{uniform.pdf}
        \caption{Uniform parametrization of the parameter values, i.e.,
    \begin{equation}
        \notag
        \left\{ t_j \right\}_{j=0}^{N-1} = \left\{ 0, 1, \ldots, N-1 \right\}.
    \end{equation}
    As $N$ increases, we see that the interpolating polynomial converges fairly
quickly to the unit semi circle. The uniform parametrization yields a good
interpolation.}

            The parameter values for $N = 15$ ended up being
            $$\left\{t_j\right\}_{0}^{14} = \left\{2, 4,  5,  6,
            8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25\right\},$$ and for lower $N$ a
        subsequence of this was used.}

    \section*{Exercise 1.4}
    \label{sec:exercise_1_4}
    
    In this exercise we look at the de Casteljau algorithm for computing points
    on a B\'ezier curve. It is very similar to the Neville-Aitken algorithm,
    however there is one big difference.  While the Neville-Aitken algorithm
    parametrizes on adjacent parameter intervals, yielding convex combinations
    only in the last step of the algorithm, the de Casteljau algorithm
    parametrizes each line segment over the same interval. This has the added
    benefit of convex combinations in every step of the algorithm and yields
    higher numerical stability. Due to this, the resulting curve interpolates
    only the first and the last control point, hence the interpolatory nature
    of the Neville-Aitken is lost. The algorithm was implemented in \textsc{Python}
    and the code can be seen in \Cref{lst:decasteljau}.

    Using the same data as in the previous exercise the resulting curve can be
    seen in \Cref{fig:bezier}. As we can see the interpolation property has
    been lost for the interior control points.
